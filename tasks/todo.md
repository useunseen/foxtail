# Review Follow-Up Plan

- [x] Re-scope review follow-up to exclude admin/dashboard auth hardening for this local-only mock service.
- [x] Refactor dashboard/resource/trend handlers so they do not all compute the full dashboard payload.
- [x] Surface dashboard database failures explicitly instead of returning empty success responses.
- [x] Improve read-path scalability with tighter query bounds and time-first indexes where current query shapes need them.
- [x] Replace hardcoded tested/coverage claims with honest scorecard values derived from what is actually verified.
- [x] Add focused Rust tests for CloudWatch pagination, dashboard/status routes, and scorecard behavior.
- [x] Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`, then capture results here.

## Review

- User clarified on 2026-03-11 that admin and dashboard auth is intentionally out of scope because this is a local mock service.
- Remaining work is limited to performance, reliability, and verification gaps from the review.

## Results

- Added route-specific dashboard builders so `/_mock/dashboard/resources`, `/_mock/dashboard/trends/cloudwatch`, and `/_mock/dashboard/trends/cost` no longer all build the full dashboard payload.
- Dashboard data endpoints now return a 500 JSON error instead of silently converting database failures into empty success payloads.
- Added a new migration for time-first dashboard/cost indexes and bounded `GetMetricData` query fan-out plus SQL-backed pagination for `GetDimensionValues`.
- Coverage scorecard now reports untested status honestly instead of claiming perfect verification.
- Added 7 Rust tests covering status, dashboard scorecard/error handling, Cost Explorer pagination, CloudWatch JSON pagination, CloudWatch XML query handling, and scenario mutation.
- Verification commands completed successfully:
  - `cargo fmt`
  - `cargo test`
  - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`

## Current Planning Focus

- [x] Normalize Cost Explorer target aliasing so CLI-emitted `AWSInsightsIndexService.*` requests reach all existing handlers.
- [x] Restore CLI-usable grouped `GetCostAndUsage` output for seeded dimensions.
- [x] Add CloudWatch `ListMetrics` so CLI-only users can discover metrics without `/_mock/*`.
- [x] Add route tests plus a reproducible AWS CLI smoke check for the public surface.
- [x] Implement the details captured in `docs/plans/2026-03-11-fix-aws-cli-api-interoperability-plan.md`.

## CLI Interoperability Results

- Cost Explorer now accepts both `AWSCostExplorer.*` and `AWSInsightsIndexService.*` targets for the implemented operations.
- `GetCostAndUsage` now returns populated groups for supported dimensions, which restores CLI-usable service breakdowns.
- CloudWatch Query/XML now supports `ListMetrics`, enabling public metric discovery before `get-metric-data` and `get-metric-statistics`.
- Added `scripts/verify_cli_interop.sh` and `make verify-cli-interoperability` for repeatable AWS CLI smoke verification.
- Verification completed successfully:
  - `cargo fmt`
  - `cargo test`
  - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`
  - `bash scripts/verify_cli_interop.sh`
